Repository for Quantifying Valence and Arousal in Text with Multilingual Pre-trained Transformers 


## Dataset
The dataset proposed in this paper was built collecting 34 different public datasets of annotated data for the emotional dimensions of Valence and Arousal.
All the datasets used free to use for research purposes, although some require an authorization to use. For this reason, we cannot publicly provide the dataset we used to train our models. The procedure used and the dataset sources are detailed below.
